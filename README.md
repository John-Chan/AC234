AC234
=====

AC234 it a small iOS App for my own needs. It's an album for photos and videos, which can be played via Airplay as slideshows for the photos.

I use CocoaAsyncSocket from:

AirplayKit (I don't think its compatible with the Apple Guidelines) which I adapt to ARC and to CocoaAsyncSocket:

CocoaHTTPServer which works fast and great!
